In Judaism, Satan is seen as an agent subservient to Yahweh, typically regarded as a metaphor for the \"\"yetzer hara\"\", or \"\"evil inclination.\"\" In Christianity and Islam, he is usually seen as a fallen angel or jinn who has rebelled against God, who nevertheless allows him temporary power over the fallen world and a host of demons. In the Quran, Shaitan, also known as Iblis, is an entity made of fire who was cast out of Heaven because he refused to bow before the newly-created Adam and incites humans to sin by infecting their minds with \"\"waswās\"\" (\"\"evil suggestions\"\"). A figure known as \"\"ha-satan\"\" (\"\"the satan\"\") first appears in the Hebrew Bible as a heavenly prosecutor, subordinate to Yahweh (God), who prosecutes the nation of Judah in the heavenly court and tests the loyalty of Yahweh's followers. During the intertestamental period, possibly due to influence from the Zoroastrian figure of Angra Mainyu, the satan developed into a malevolent entity with abhorrent qualities in dualistic opposition to God. In the apocryphal Book of Jubilees, Yahweh grants the satan (referred to as Mastema) authority over a group of fallen angels, or their offspring, to tempt humans to sin and punish them. \" ", "id": "150", "question_lang": "Bushe satana alitala abapo Malaika wa kwa Lesa?", "question_translated": "Was satan an Angel of God before?", "title": "Satan", "answer_lang": "Ni malaika wapondwekwe"}

The common practice of placing crosses and crucifixes in churches was viewed as a graven image in their eyes or a form of idolatry.

They also incorporated in their own practices relationships with objects and actions like dancing and chanting. When Africans were able to read in the vernacular, they were able to interpret the Bible in their own light.
